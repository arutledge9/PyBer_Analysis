# Pyber with Matplotlib

## Overview

I've been working with my coworker, Omar, at the ridesharing company Pyber to analyze ride data across many cities for our CEO utilizing Pandas DataFrames and the Matplotlib library. This particular assignment entailed creating a summary DataFrame of the ridesharing data by city type - urban, suburban, and rural - and then plotting the data on a multiple-line graph to illustrate the city types' weekly fares across approximately four months so I can provide Pyber with data-driven insights on the differences between the city types to best drive business decisions.

## Results

I began my analysis by digging into the differences between the city types' data as detailed on the summary DataFrame:
